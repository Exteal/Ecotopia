# Presentation

This project implements the core structure of a multi-agents simulation that aims to scientifically assess an alternative sustainable society over a 50-100 year time horizon.
The proposed normative approach makes it possible to experiment with models of fictive societies _a priori_ perceived as "ideal" which that could inspire our current world, while maintaining a scientific approach.

The book Ecotopia, written by Ernest Callenbach in 1975, describes a utopian society centred on respect for nature and individual and social well-being in which the primary objective is no longer development but the maintenance of ecological balance.
As climate change looms, the society described within Ecotopia presents an interesting test-case.

This repo is used as the reference world from witch all of the proposed alternative universe derive.
MWI, the repo name, stands for Many-Worlds Interpretation as a reference to the Everett interpretation (see see quantum physics).
    
The project is written using the [GAMA platform v1.8.2-RC2](https://gama-platform.org/)
